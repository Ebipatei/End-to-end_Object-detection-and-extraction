# End-to-end_Object-detection-and-extraction
Build an end to end object detection deep learning model, from inception to production.


This repo uses the [ImageAI open-source python library](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI) to build deep learning applications for objection detection and by extension object extraction if you so desire.
